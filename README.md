# RenderATL 2024 Workshop: What’s wrong with my app?: Using OpenTelemetry to observe your code 

**Workshop requirements:** 
1. Laptop
2. A Github account
3. A (free!) New Relic account -- sign up [here](https://newrelic.com/signup) with your personal (not work!) email

## What is this workshop about? 
Having observability into your applications and infrastructure empowers you with multiple benefits, such as being able to pinpoint issues in your code down to the line, minimize application downtime, and ensure your system is running smoothly. These, and many more benefits, are only possible when you have observability into your applications and infrastructure. 

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/) is both a framework and a tool for implementing observability, and [New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/intro-new-relic/) is a data visualization and storage platform. By leveraging OpenTelemetry and New Relic, you can achieve observability. In this beginner-level workshop, you’ll use the [OpenTelemetry Demo App](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/) to learn about OpenTelemetry instrumentation, basic Collector architecture, and how to debug common issues, such as missing data, as well as how to navigate your traces, metrics, and logs in New Relic.

## Why do I need this repo?
We will be creating a [codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) using this repo, which is a fork of the OpenTelemetry Demo and contains a few modifications for this workshop. You can view the original repo by switching to the main branch, or by clicking [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo). 

This README also contains handy links and snippets to copy and paste for the workshop. 

## What is the OpenTelemetry Demo app?
This repository contains a fork of the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop, which is a microservice-based
distributed system intended to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in
a near real-world environment. 

The labs in this workshop utilize the demo to illustrate a few key concepts, including instrumentation. 

## The workshop labs

These are the labs that we will be completing in this workshop (COMING SOON).
